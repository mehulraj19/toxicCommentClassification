# toxicCommentClassification

This is my academic project and in this, I have used different ML alogorithms for text classification. I have used tf-idf vectorizers to vectorize the text data that further goes 
for implementation of the models. We have done vectorizer for both word and character and then made a union set which is finally used to vectorize data. This helps in removing 
the stop words as well.
<br> The data has been taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification/data">here</a>.
<br><br>
Models implemented:
<ul>
    <li>MultinomialNB</li>
    <li>RandomForestClassifier</li>
    <li>LogisticRegression</li>
    <li>SGDClassifier</li>
    <li>Perceptron</li>
    <li>MLPClassifier</li>
</ul>
